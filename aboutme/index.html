          <p>Who is Oliver Poultney?</p>
          <p>I am a web developer and designer that only discovered coding in 2017. I was born in 1979. This means I was born before a lot of todays’ technology even existed.</p>
          <p>We had color television growing up, but they were housed in wooden boxes. My first cell-phone was inherited from my oldest sister, and it could only call and text. I was 21 at that stage. To access photos, videos, games, and the internet on it was something out of a science fiction movie.</p>
          <p>Nowhere in my wildest dreams did I ever fathom that I would be given the chance to learn coding. Neither had I ever thought that I would someday contribute anything that would be “published” on the World Wide Web.</p>
          <p>Oh how our lives can change.</p>
          <p>I am still busy studying coding, and via my course material, colleagues, classmates and Google, I get to learn something new each and every day.</p>
          <p>I have always seen myself as being a creative spirit, trying to focus on the glass that is half full. I am also a bit of a perfectionist. I will spend hours going over the finest detail of your website, so that you will be as excited about it as I am. Lastly I have a good sense of humour, I love my family to bits, and I can solve a Rubik’s cube in less than 3 minutes.</p>
          <p>Give me a chance to get to know you and your business, so that I may give you the very best product that I can.</p>
          <p>I will treat you like you are my only client, because most probably, you are.</p>
